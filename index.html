<h2 id="im-matt-miller.">I’m Matt Miller.</h2>

<p><em>Researcher, Writer, Midwesterner</em></p>

<p>I was once described as “flat, but in a good way.” As a Nebraskan, I take that as a compliment.</p>
<p>I am a researcher, writer, and teacher with abiding interests in liturgy, media, and place. Trained in rhetoric—the ancient discipline that studies persuasion and communication—I work in marketing, teach on the side, and write about history, sustainability, and place.</p>
